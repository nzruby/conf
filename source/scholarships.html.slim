      p We want to support people with different voices and ideas to attend Kiwi Ruby.
      p The Ruby community should reflect the diversity and vibrancy of New Zealand, and people from underrepresented backgrounds should have the opportunity to participate fully in our community.
      p The Diversity Scholarship is for people who would otherwise not be able to afford to make it to Kiwi Ruby, but would benefit from attending.
