This is the repository for the Kiwi Ruby website. 

### Pull requests

Kiwi Ruby is a community conference, Ruby NZ is a community organisation, and we welcome community involvement. We are happy to receive PRs from anyone with:

- Performance optimisation
- General behind the scenes improvements
- Fixing spelling mistakes, links etc

However, we won't accept PRs from people who aren't already involved with the conference if they contain:

- Significant amounts of new content (with some exceptions, like changes to your own speaker bio)
- Significant design changes

If the PR is after the event and a new one hasn't been announced, there may be no one around to review it.

### Issues

We will close issues that are about the **conference** rather than about the **conference website**.

For example, you could open an issue requesting more information about the venue, but we will close an issue if you request we move to a different venue. 

If you have feedback about the **conference** get in touch with us at kiwi@ruby.nz.
