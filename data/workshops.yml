  - title: "Next Generation Web Apps with dry-rb"
    slug: "dry-rb"
    long: "Full day"
    level: "Intermediate level"
    description: "Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it’s time to leave Ruby (gasp!) for something different?

If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!

Come along and learn how to build a new generation of Ruby web app with dry-rb: an app that is robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later."

  - title: "Defensive DevOps"
    slug: "defensive-devops"
    long: "Half-day"
    level: "Intermediate level"
    description: "The DevOps revolution is in full swing, with a variety of tools and techniques being announced and implemented every day. Our systems no longer look to deploy on physical hardware, instead aiming to be hosted on the cloud and other virtualised systems.
But, how do we do this securely? All these automation tools are still programming, and programming is always filled with bugs and security holes.
In this session, we will go through the rise of the DevOps revolution, and what it means both from a technical and cultural standpoint. We’ll talk about how to model where your points of failure will be, and which ones will be the most catastrophic. We’ll talk about security, how it’s a reliability concern, and how best to make it part of your journey to sustainability.
This workshop will be presented by aurynn shaw, founder of Eiara - Sustainable DevOps"
