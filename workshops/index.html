Our systems no longer look to deploy on physical hardware, instead aiming to be hosted on the cloud and other virtualised systems.</p><p>But, how do we do this securely? All these automation tools are still programming, and programming is always filled with bugs and security holes.</p><p>In this session, we will go through the rise of the DevOps revolution, and what it means both from a technical and cultural standpoint. Weâ€™ll talk about how to model where your points of failure will be, and which ones will be the most catastrophic. Weâ€™ll talk about security, how itâ€™s a reliability concern, and how best to make it part of your journey to sustainability.</p><p>This workshop will be presented by aurynn shaw, founder of Eiara - Sustainable DevOps</p></div></div><div class="c-workshop__presenter"><div class="c-workshop__presenter-details"><img alt="aurynn shaw" class="c-speaker__avatar c-speaker__avatar--small" src="/images/workshop-avatars/aurynn-7257593c.jpeg" /><h3 class="c-presenter__title">aurynn shaw</h3><div class="c-workshop__presenter-bio"><p>aurynn is the founder of Eiara, a DevOps consultancy based out of Wellington, New Zealand, focussing on helping clients develop technical DevOps capability, and the cultural knowledge to use it. aurynn brings a unique expertise in integrating deployment and security to the modern software development process, by treating both as part of the broader reliability and maintenance workflow.
